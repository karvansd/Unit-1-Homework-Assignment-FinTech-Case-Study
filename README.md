    - Store of value: Nanopay offers a digital cash mechanism. The digital cash is equal to fiat currency enabling the instantaneous and secure transactions, as well as guaranteed value and usability for its users.
    * Payment network: network effects are essential for nanopay to maximize the value users can extract from the platform.
