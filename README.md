  * In Series A it raised $10 million dollars of funding in 2016 [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3).

  ## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  - Nanopay is revolutionizing how payments are made between businesses, financial institutions and central bank customers. They offer a digital payment solution which improves in both efficiency and scalability the current payment system that is used in the industry. Their open and flexible APIs enable banks, payment services providers and businesses to use the platform for low-cost, real-time payment applications in both domestic and cross-border payments securely and instantaneously. They allow businesses to scale by offering innovative payment and liquidity management products [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2).

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

  - The intended customers of nanopay are businesses. They hope to increase the ease and efficiency of digital payments in the B2B marketplace [[1]](#1).

  * There is a large market size of this set of customers, however there are still many innovative infrastructure and regulatory hurdles that need to be addressed before the B2B marketplace can be fully tapped by FinTech [[1]](#1).

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  - Two key capabilities of nanopay that power its product offerings and value proposition:
    - Store of value: Nanopay offers a digital cash mechanism. The digital cash is equal to fiat currency enabling the instantaneous and secure transactions, as well as guaranteed value and usability for its users [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).
    * Payment network: network effects are essential for nanopay to maximize the value users can extract from the platform. Nanopay has partnered recently with BePay [[5]](#5) to enable cross-border payments for their customers further increasing their total network size. This increases its total network effect and enables more transactions between parties on the network within and across borders [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).

  * Specifically within their payment ecosystem they enable their customers to go to market faster via the digital cash mechanism as they add an easy way to add account-to-account payments to the service or platform their customer provides. Their payments product has customer on-boarding, anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and fraud monitoring all integrated within making it easier for their clients to scale their business with efficiency and peace of mind that they are meeting all regulatory requirements [[1]](#1).

  - Their payment solution is also low-cost by moving money directly between bank accounts since they do not go through intermediaries. They also have competitive and affordable foreign exchange rates [[1]](#1).

  * The digital cash mechanism also enables their liquidity management product for businesses, which goes above and beyond traditional liquidity management mechanisms. Their clients can manage internal payments from a central platform across all units. The current cash position can be known allowing businesses to free up trapped capital and invest funds [[1]](#1).

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

  - The nanopay platform is built using hybrid blockchain technology, combining blockchain features and conventional databases. Specifically, they used a Centralized Ledger Technology (CLT) that is cryptographically secure. The CLT is implemented to improve throughput of their digital payment service, simplify the governance and reduce security costs by leveraging an immutable ledger. The nanopay CLT technology is also very fast and can handle up to 50k transactions per section, which is ~2500x faster than decentralized blockchain payment products [[1]](#1).

  * The full stack of technologies that they use include: [[4]](#4)
    - Application and Data
      - PHP
      * NGINX
      * Bootstrap
      * UIkIt
    - Utilities
      - Google Analytics
    * Business Tools
      - WordPress
      * G Suite
      * Zendesk

* ## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  - The FinTech domain that nanopay is in is payments and billing [[1]](#1).

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  - In the domain of payments 5 key factors have had a tremendous impact on the payments industry over the course of the last 5 years [[9]](#9).
    - Changed customer behaviour
    * Changed competitive environment
    * New regulatory initiatives
    * New technologies
    * Changed market infrastructure

  * Changed customer behaviour:
    - The general requirements from the customer for a successful payment currently are being fast, simple, secure, cost-effective and anonymous [[9]](#9). According to the McKinsey 2020 report the global pandemic has drastically accelerated trends in customer demand and usage of digital payments in ecommerce and other services [[10]](#10).
  * Changed competitive environment:

    - The world of digital payments is ever increasing compared to its cash based alternatives. The 2020 McKinsey report also shows a drastic 10 year decrease of cash based payments relative to digital payments in both mature and emerging markets [[10]](#10).
    - Digital payments, specifically via cell phones or mobile payments, have increased over the past decade to currently exist in many countries. This has drastically increased the number of FinTech companies competing to offer differentiated services that are both flexible in design and price [[9]](#9)[[10]](#10).

  * Regulatory Initiatives:

    - Legislative pressure and regulation on the payments sector has also increased, especially in the last few years. Regulatory initiatives are mainly aimed at further harmonizing payments, which increases consumer protection and promotes innovation [[9]](#9).

  * Technologies:

    - Technologies are continuing to be developed and evolve as the competitive market among FinTech startups and larger corporations, like Apple, compete to offer services that meet the ever-changing customer demands [[9]](#9).
    - Over the past decade an increase of digital payments and decline in physical methods such as checks ( which was the most common mode of universal money transfer method especially between businesses) has caused an increase in the widespread use of digital payment methods such as: mobile wallet, mobile POS, NFC, mobile P2P transfer (i.e. Venmo), payments in apps, carrier billing (i.e. Amazon Prime), online payment services (i.e. PayPal) and WeChat [[11]](#11).

    * Currently, two revolutionary technologies impacting payments now are AI and open banking [[9]](#9).
    * Other key payment innovations as of 2020 include: Strong Customer Autheniczation (SCA), biometric identification, increased focus on back office integration, exception of accepted payments at banks due to payment innovations in FinTech, increased collaboration between banks and FinTech startups, and growth in variety and volume of non-cash payments [[12]](#12).

  * Market Infrastructure:
    - Various global initiatives are underway with the aim of modernizing the payment infrastructure and replacing the outdated payment infrastructure that still exists in the market today [[9]](#9).

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
  - The other major companies in this domain are any payment platforms for retail and P2P applications. These include larger companies such as Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, etc [[2]](#2).
  - Other rival FinTech companies that offer similar services include Zeta Account, Pesapal, SmoothPay, Soundpays and Plooto [[7]](#7) [[8]](#8).

## Results

- What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  - So far the company has generated $1B in value for investors [[1]](#1).

  * Nanopay also recently (December 2020) partnered with BePay, a financial innovation company in Brazil, to enable cross-border payments for their customers. This will eventually enable all BePay customers to send both inbound and outbound payments to the 150+ countries in nanopays network [[5]](#5).

- What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  - Acquisition metrics - how many new customers you gain (customer acquisition) [[6]](#6).
  - Activation metrics - how successful you are at getting people to utilize your product [[6]](#6).
  - Retention metrics - keeping people engaged with your product and retaining customers [[6]](#6).
  - Referrals - willingness of customers to recommend your product [[6]](#6).
  - Revenues [[6]](#6).
  - Market metrics - what specific marketing approach is attracting customers [[6]](#6).
  - Technical metrics - ease of user and customer experience with your product. Making sure your product is running optimally meeting the increasing demands of the customer [[6]](#6).

- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  - Relative to competitors the company is performing in the same ballpark range for total funding (most around $10 Million), it has 54 employees which is on the larger size for FinTech’s in the similar funding range [[7]](#7) [[8]](#8).

  - Compared to competitors such as ApplePay and AmazonPay, it has more flexibility in terms of being a smaller FinTech Startup meaning it can easily adapt and offer diverse and targeted products to it’s clients when change is needed. The ease of being able to easily adapt to clients demands helps to create a scalable digital cash system for B2B and B2C payments [[1]](#1).

## Recommendations

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

  - The product that I would suggest to offer would be computer vision and biometric technology.

- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  - Computer vision and biometric technology would add an extra and secure layer of identification. This would help with monitoring for fraud and the added security would also help facilitate in transactions both domestically, but especially across borders. This would help with KYC protocols and help to ensure that a person has to biometrically confirm an account is theirs before sending a transaction. It is hard to fool such systems built off of AI technology, which adds to their security. As well, authorizing payments with computer vision identification, also saves time by not having to use cash or credit card.

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  - Computer vision and biometric technology. The underlying technology hear being AI. Artificial intelligence improves algorithms when performing biometric scans and also checks for live-ness [[13]](#13).

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - Since nanopay is trying to achieve a secure, instantaneouse, boarderless and scalable product adding computer vision and biometric technology into their service would only further help them achieve this goal [[14]](#14).
